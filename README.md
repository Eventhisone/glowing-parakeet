# A website using html, css, js, and php

## I am creating this website while wirking through (PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites 5th edition)[http://www.larryullman.com/books/php-and-mysql-for-dynamic-web-sites-visual-quickpro-guide-5th-edition/] by Larry Ullman. It not original and not secure enough to used as an actual application. However it is a lot of fun to play with.
